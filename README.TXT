# heap1-protostar-exploit-PoC
A PoC for code execution against the heap1 binary from protostar exploit exercises

For this exploitation challenge I decided to further my confidence when working with the heap. I decided to instead of doing what the challenge objective (Redirect code execution to a call) that I was gonna pop a shell!

I wanted to do this without putting any shellcode on the stack (so no egghunter etc). The hardest part of popping a shell on this binary was the little amount of space I could use to store shellcode!
